## SMU MSDS 7330 Fall 2016 File Organization and Database Term paper

For this paper an open source GTIN database called Product Open Data (http://www.product-open-data.com/) was used to learn about Global Trade Identification numbers (The numbers found on product barcodes)
GS1.ORG  (http://www.gs1.org/)is the global standards organization that assigns unique company ID codes (Global Company Prefix) worldwide.
A GTIN consists of a company code, item ID code, and a check digit
Each company assigns and maintains their item ID codes 
Product Open Data was a little disappointing, it appears to have been abandoned in 2014, but was still very usefull in understanding Global Trade Item Numbers
