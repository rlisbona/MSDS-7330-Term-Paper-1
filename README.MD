## SMU MSDS 7330 Fall 2016 File Organization and Database Term paper

For this paper an open source GTIN database called Product Open Data was used to learn about Global Trade Identification numbers (The numbers found on product barcodes)
GS1.ORG is the global standards organization that assigns unique company ID codes (Global Company Prefix) worldwide.
A GTIN consists of a company code, item ID code, and a check digit
Each company assigns and maintains their item ID codes 
Product Open Data was a little disappointing, it appears to have been abandoned in 2014, but was still very usefull in understanding Global Trade Item Numbers
